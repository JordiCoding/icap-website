‚è≥ CMS integration (pending)

## Next Steps
1. Design and implement Hygraph schema for fund data
2. Add loading states and error handling
3. Implement data fetching from CMS
4. Add unit tests for components
5. Implement error boundaries

## Notes
- All geometric icons (cube, pyramid, hexagon) are optimized SVGs
- Card spacing accounts for hover effect to prevent layout shifts
- Navigation controls use ICAP's brand color (#C87D55)
- Description text is limited to 3 lines with ellipsis
- Risk level badges use consistent padding and rounded corners
