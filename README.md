# ICAP Bilingual Website

A fully responsive bilingual website (Arabic/English) built with React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4. This project is a collaboration, and this document serves as a log of our development process and key architectural decisions.

## üöÄ Project Status (Last Updated: Core Components Complete)

### ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Project Foundation & Layout Shell (Complete)**

We successfully set up the project from scratch, including configuring the development environment (Node.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4) and establishing a robust architecture for a bilingual, responsive website.

### ‚úÖ **Phase 2: Core Component & Section Development (Complete)**

This phase focused on building reusable components and the first content sections of the landing page.

1.  **"Your Portfolio" Section**:
    *   Built the initial section with a background image and text content.
    *   Refined layout, spacing, and colors based on precise design feedback.

2.  **Reusable `TextBlock` Component (`/components/common/TextBlock.tsx`)**:
    *   **Decision**: To avoid repeating code, we created a generic `TextBlock` component to handle a recurring pattern (title, subtitle, actions).
    *   **Implementation**: It's a flexible component that accepts a `title`, `subtitle`, and a generic `actions` node, allowing it to render anything from a single button to a group of app store badges. It also supports a `variant` prop for use on light or dark backgrounds.

3.  **"Margin Lending" Section**:
    *   Served as the first implementation of our reusable `TextBlock`.
    *   **Challenge**: We faced significant challenges with bilingual text that required specific line breaks and styled sub-components (the gold "Margin Lending" text).
    *   **Solution**: After several iterations, we landed on a robust structural pattern. The parent "Section" component defines a content box with a set width and alignment (`justify-end`, `rtl:justify-start`). The child `TextBlock` component lives inside this box and is only responsible for its internal text styling. This pattern is now our standard for building similar sections and has proven to work flawlessly for both LTR and RTL layouts.

4.  **Reusable `Button` Component (`/components/ui/Button.tsx`)**:
    *   **Decision**: To ensure all call-to-action elements are consistent, we built a reusable `Button` component.
    *   **Implementation**: It's a polymorphic component (can be rendered as `<button>` or `<a>`) with `primary` (filled, gold) and `secondary` (outline, white) variants.
    *   **Challenge**: The button styles were not applying correctly at first.
    *   **Solution**: We identified an error in our Tailwind CSS v4 configuration. The issue was resolved by correctly defining our custom brand colors under the `--color-*` namespace in `index.css` (e.g., `--color-icap-gold: #EECA60;`) and restarting the dev server to ensure the theme changes were picked up.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Phase 3: Navigation & Interactivity (Current Phase)**

This is our current focus.

*   **Next Step**: Build out the main site **navigation**, including the mobile hamburger menu and dropdowns.

### ‚è≥ **Phase 4: Remaining Content & Internal Pages (Upcoming)**

*   Build remaining landing page sections.
*   Set up all application routes for the 25-35 pages.
*   Build out all internal pages using the established components.

## üõ† Tech Stack
*   **React 18** with TypeScript
*   **Vite** for fast development
*   **Tailwind CSS 4.x** with the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin
*   **react-i18next** for internationalization
*   **React Router DOM** for navigation

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Ensure you are using the correct Node.js version.** If you have `nvm` installed, you can run `nvm use` to switch to the version specified in `.nvmrc`.
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## üìù Architectural Notes & Key Decisions

-   **Component-Driven Development**: We are building the UI from small, reusable components (`Button`, `TextBlock`) up to larger "Section" components and finally "Page" components.
-   **Styling with Tailwind v4**: All custom theme properties (colors, fonts) are defined as CSS variables under the `@theme` directive in `src/index.css`. This is the modern, config-less approach.
-   **Bilingual Layout Pattern**: For sections with content aligned to one side, the parent section component is responsible for creating a sized and positioned "content box". The child component (`TextBlock`) is placed inside this box and is only responsible for its own content, not its position on the page. This ensures robust LTR/RTL behavior.
-   **Polymorphic Components**: Components like `Button` are built to be polymorphic (using `as` prop), allowing them to render as different HTML elements (e.g., `<button>` or `<a>`) for better semantic HTML and accessibility.

# Mutual Fund Calculator

## Project Scope

This project is a modern, accessible, and responsive web calculator for projecting the future value of mutual fund investments based on historical NAV (Net Asset Value) and dividend data. It is designed for both internal demo and future production use, supporting multiple funds and extensible to live data sources.

### Core Features (Phase 1)
- Input: Initial deposit (default 50,000 SAR)
- Timeframe selection: 1Y, 3Y, 5Y, 10Y
- Output:
  - Projected fund value (using historical CAGR)
  - Average annual return (CAGR)
  - Dividends earned (if applicable)
- Line chart showing fund growth over time
- Responsive, accessible UI matching Figma design

### Future Phases
- Multi-fund support (dropdown selector)
- Dynamic data source (API/backend, daily updates)
- Recurring investments, export, user accounts, and more

## Data Requirements

### 1. NAV Data (Net Asset Value)
- Daily or periodic NAVs for each fund
- JSON array, one object per date

```
[
  { "date": "2015-01-01", "nav": 10.00 },
  { "date": "2015-01-02", "nav": 10.01 },
  ...
]
```

### 2. Dividend Data (Optional, per fund)
- Quarterly (or periodic) dividend payouts
- JSON array, one object per payout

```
[
  { "date": "2015-03-31", "amount": 100 },
  { "date": "2015-06-30", "amount": 120 },
  ...
]
```

### 3. Multi-Fund Support (Phase 2+)
- Store as an object keyed by fund name or code:

```
{
  "FundA": {
    "navs": [ ... ],
    "dividends": [ ... ]
  },
  "FundB": {
    "navs": [ ... ],
    "dividends": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

## How to Upload Data
- Place your JSON file(s) in `/src/data/`.
- For Phase 1, use `navs.json` and (optionally) `dividends.json` for a single fund.
- For multi-fund, use `funds.json` as shown above.

## Calculation Logic
- CAGR is calculated for each timeframe using actual NAVs.
- Dividends are summed for the selected period.
- Lump sum investment only (no recurring for now).

## Accessibility & Best Practices
- Fully responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Accessible (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Calculation logic separated in `/utils`

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **1. Arabic Translation Causing White Screen**

**Problem**: When switching to Arabic (AR), the screen goes white and the application crashes.

**Root Cause**: Usually caused by one of these issues:
- NewsroomSection component has null `featuredImage` references
- Race conditions in `useNewsData` hook during language changes
- Missing null-safety checks in data transformation

**Solution**:
```typescript
// In NewsroomSection.tsx - Add null-safety to image handling
const newsArticles: NewsCardProps[] = articles.map(article => ({
  id: article.id,
  slug: article.slug,
  title: article.title,
  description: article.excerpt,
  image: article.featuredImage?.url || '',  // ‚Üê null-safety check
  date: article.publishedDate,
  featured: article.featured
}));
```

### **2. Images Not Loading in Arabic Version**

**Problem**: Arabic content loads but images are broken/missing.

**Root Cause**: Arabic articles in Hygraph may not have `featuredImage` assigned - only English versions have images.

**Solution**: Update GraphQL queries to use fallback locales:
```typescript
// In src/utils/queries.ts
export const GET_NEWS_ARTICLES = gql`
  query GetNewsArticles($locale: Locale!, $first: Int = 10) {
    articles(
      locales: [$locale, en]  // ‚Üê Add English as fallback
      orderBy: publishedDate_DESC
      first: $first
    ) {
      // ... rest of query
    }
  }
`;
```

### **3. NewsDetailPage Not Showing Arabic Content**

**Problem**: News detail pages show English content even when Arabic is selected.

**Root Cause**: NewsDetailPage component hardcoded to use `locale: 'en'` in GraphQL query.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// In NewsDetailPage.tsx - Use current language
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

const NewsDetailPage: React.FC = () => {
  const { i18n } = useTranslation();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const data = await hygraphClient.request(GET_ARTICLE_BY_SLUG, { 
      slug,
      locale: i18n.language || 'en'  // ‚Üê Use current language
    });
  }, [slug, i18n.language]);  // ‚Üê Add language to dependencies
};
```

### **4. "[object Object]" Displaying Instead of Content**

**Problem**: Article content shows as `[object Object]` instead of actual text.

**Root Cause**: Hygraph returns rich text as `{ html: string }` object, not plain string.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Wrong ‚ùå
dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: article.content }}

// Correct ‚úÖ
dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: article.content.html }}
```

### **5. Compilation Errors: "Identifier Already Declared"**

**Problem**: TypeScript compilation fails with variable name conflicts.

**Root Cause**: Multiple variables with same name (e.g., `article`) in different scopes.

**Solution**: Use unique, descriptive variable names:
```typescript
// Instead of generic names
const article = ...
const data = ...

// Use specific names
const currentArticle = ...
const newsData = ...
```

### **6. Infinite Re-render Loops**

**Problem**: Components re-render endlessly, causing performance issues.

**Root Cause**: Missing dependencies in `useEffect` or `useCallback`.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Wrong ‚ùå - causes infinite loops
const fetchData = async () => { /* ... */ };
useEffect(() => { fetchData(); }, [fetchData]);

// Correct ‚úÖ - stable function reference
const fetchData = useCallback(async () => { /* ... */ }, [dependency]);
useEffect(() => { fetchData(); }, [fetchData]);
```

### **7. Development Server Issues**

**Problem**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) not working or changes not reflecting.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
pkill -f "vite"
npm run dev

# Check for syntax errors in terminal
# Look for duplicate variable declarations
```

### **Quick Debugging Checklist**
1. ‚úÖ Check browser console for errors
2. ‚úÖ Verify GraphQL queries in Hygraph playground
3. ‚úÖ Add null-safety checks to data transformations
4. ‚úÖ Use unique variable names
5. ‚úÖ Check useEffect dependencies
6. ‚úÖ Restart dev server if HMR issues persist
